## About Me

I'm just a regular everyday normal whaka-whaka (c).
Seems like there is nothing special about me.
Nevertheless, I really like learning new skills and once I've tried to make a website just for fun.
The more I've studied the more I needed. 
So at the end it brought me here cuz self-studying is kinda difficult and sometimes you just don't have a clue about what's going on.
Rs-school has the reputation of really high-level educational course and it seems the right place to get new knowledge and practical experience.

## Skills

* __HTML__
* __CSS__
* __JavaScript__(basic)
* __NodeJs__(basic)
* __Database__(mongodb, basic)
* __Git, GitHub__

## Code Example

Longest vowel chain kata from codewars:

```
function solve(s){
  let result = 0;
  let arr = s.replace(/[a||e||i||o||u]/g, '1').replace(/\D/g, '0').split('0');
  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
      if (arr[i].length > result) result = arr[i].length;
  }
  return result;
}
```

## Experience
